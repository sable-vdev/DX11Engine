# DX11Engine — Custom DirectX 11 Rendering Engine in C++

DX11Engine is a custom rendering engine built from scratch in C++ using DirectX 11. It currently supports object loading, camera movement, shader programming, and Phong lighting. The engine is designed as a foundation for developing a full-featured game engine and demonstrates my applied knowledge in low-level graphics programming and engine architecture.

## Technologies Used
- **C++** — core programming language
- **DirectX 11** — graphics API and rendering pipeline
- **ImGui** — GUI overlay for engine control
- **STB** — texture loading
- **Assimp** — 3D model import

## Current Features / Skills Demonstrated
- Render queue submission — understanding of rendering pipeline management
- 3D object loading — experience with model import and asset management
- Camera movement — basic 3D navigation and input handling
- Texture loading & shader programming — low-level graphics pipeline implementation
- Basic lighting (Phong) — applied lighting models in real-time rendering

## Planned Enhancements
- Implement Physically Based Rendering (PBR) — advanced graphics rendering
- Improve GUI overlay with ImGui — enhanced visualization and debugging
- Add multithreading support — performance optimization for complex scenes

## Inspiration
This engine builds upon Rastertek's DirectX 11 tutorials as a learning foundation. All implementations have been extended and customized, demonstrating my ability to understand, adapt, and extend low-level graphics programming independently.
